            Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra,
            western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built
            by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize
            his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in
            childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion
            since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely
            recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city
            on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort
            (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile
            (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.
